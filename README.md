=================

Why did I follow you?

If I followed you it is because I value your experience and I think you have done some interesting things.

Likely, I am looking to network with you, or maybe even see if you personally would be looking for new opportunities. 

If you are not looking, please don't take offense if I ask, but take is as a compliment. Keep me in mind for when things change and you might be interested in seeing what is out there.

Thanks!
